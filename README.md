Learning python for algorhythmic trading and data science(analysis/visualization)

I learn how to get PSE daily stock data thru a software called 'PSE Get' ->ctto which converts the daily PDF to daily csv files.
I was able to get an Excel add-on from a friend that appends multiple sheets into one. Hence, the PSE conso.csv file.
I learned how to manipulate data into a data frame with proper indexing that will allow plotting using pd and plt.
I computed the YTD gain of the stock.

ToDos/Next Steps:
>I'll automate appending of the files into python thru pd.
>Issue#1 I want to automate the script such that the one would only need to change the TICKER and everything will compute as before.
>I am making a filtering program such that I'll get a list of stocks that are in the Stage 2 market cycle or those that are clearly advancing in price.
>As an improvement I'll convert the line graph into a legit OHLC/Candlestick chart ... or even animated SVG(if that possible).
>Probably next I will include volume data into the chart and pull-off a Minervini VCP strategy/setup.
